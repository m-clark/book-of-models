# Contributing to book-of-models

This outlines how to propose a change to book-of-models. Basically, you can treat this similar to other R/Python packages.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors by just forking and making a PR that clearly describes the proposed changes. 


## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, e.g. code or something more dramatic, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure the authors agree that it's needed.  If/when you create a PR with the changes, they should reference the issue number (e.g. `#123`) so that they will be automatically linked together.

## Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, then we recommend you just create an issue for the authors to deal with it. 

*  Create a branch in your fork to make your changes. You should branch off the `dev` branch.

*  Make any pull request back to dev.


## Allowed changes

Only changes to qmd files will be accepted unless otherwise agreed upon in an issue/discussion. There are a lot of moving parts here, and we have to satisfy both the pdf and html output. Even if your alteration would create a new image, we'd just need to qmd and will push the image later.
