## More Models


TODO: This is the list from the LM chapter, add other stuff that isn't covered and might be of interest (even if only historically)


Generalize Linear Models and related

- True GLM e.g. logistic, poisson
- Other distributions: beta regression, tweedie, t (so-called robust), truncated
- Penalized regression: ridge, lasso, elastic net
- Censored outcomes: Survival models, tobit

Multivariate/multiclass/multipart

- Multivariate regression (multiple targets)
- Multinomial/Categorical/Ordinal regression (>2 classes)
- Zero (or some number) -inflated/hurdle/altered
- Mixture models and Cluster analysis

Random Effects

- Mixed effects models (random intercepts/coefficients)
- Generalized additive models (GAMMs)
- Spatial models (CAR)
- Time series models (ARIMA)
- Factor analysis

Latent Linear Models

- PCA, Factor Analysis
- Mixture models
- Structural Equation Modeling, Graphical models generally

All of these are explicitly linear models or can be framed as such, and most are either identical in description to what you've already seen or require only a tweak or two - e.g. a different distribution, a different link function, penalizing the coefficients, etc. In other cases, we can bounce from one to the another. For example we can reshape our multivariate outcome to be amenable to a mixed model approach, and get the exact same results. We can potentially add a random effect to any model, and that random effect can be based on time, spatial or other considerations. The important thing to know is that the linear model is a very flexible tool that expands easily, and allows you to model most of the types of outcomes were interested in. As such, it's a very powerful approach to modeling.


Multi-class, rank, ordered

## Other ML

Clasical models like simple decision tree, knn-regression, svm, naive bayes, etc.


## Other DL

could mention specific/historical models here, like resnet, bert, GANs, LSTM, etc.
