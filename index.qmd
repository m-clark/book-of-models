Hi there, this is our book! It's about models great and small, and we hope you'll find some useful things here. Our main goal is to provide a resource for people who are learning about models, and we hope that it will be useful for people who are just starting out, as well as for people who are already familiar with models but want to learn from a different perspective. Whether you're a machine learning master that would like a little bit more statistical nuance, or an academic trying to dive into the world of machine learning, we hope you'll find it helpful.

You'll definitely want tok have some familiarity with R or Python, and some basic knowledge of statistics will be helpful. We'll try to explain things as we go, but we won't be able to cover everything. If you're looking for a good introduction to R, we recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) for Python. Beyond that, we'll try to provide the context you need. We're not here to make you an expert, just to help you get acquainted with the world of models.
