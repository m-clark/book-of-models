#### Parting Thoughts on Maximum Likelihood {#sec-estim-maxlike-add}
 -->
<!-- TODO: Remove? -->

<!-- One of the key things to note is that maximum likelihood is an estimation technique that relies on specifying the probability distribution that serves as the data generating process. Maximum likelihood allows us to be explicit about why we think those target values are the way they are. The likelihood also serves as a fundamental part of Bayesian analysis, which we'll discuss more later. In general, maximum likelihood is a powerful technique that can be used in many contexts, and likelihoods can be used as the objective for many machine learning algorithms as well. -->

## Estimation: Quick Review {#sec-estim-review}
 -->
<!-- TODO: MOVE WHERE? NEEDED? if anywhere just put at the end -->

<!-- At this point we understand a few things:

- Parameters are the values associated with a model
- Objective functions specify a modeling goal with which to estimate the parameters.
- Estimation is a way of finding the best model, i.e. parameters that help us achieve a goal.
- Optimization is the process of finding the parameters that maximize or minimize some objective function
- The likelihood is an alternate way to assess the match of data and model, and allows us to compare the relative fits of models
