Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, A Tutorial Introduction with R and BUGS, is for first year graduate students or advanced undergraduates and provides an accessible approach, as all mathematics is explained intuitively and with concrete examples. It assumes only algebra and ‘rusty’ calculus. Unlike other textbooks, this book begins with the basics, including essential concepts of probability and random sampling. The book gradually climbs all the way to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for realistic data. The text provides complete examples with the R programming language and BUGS software (both freeware), and begins with basic programming examples, working up gradually to complete programs for complex analyses and presentation graphics.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a regression model where the response is beta distributed using a parameterization of the beta law that is indexed by mean and dispersion parameters. The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

Here I focus on the history of modern artificial intelligence (AI) which is dominated by artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep learning, both conceptually closer to the old field of cybernetics than to what's been called AI since 1956 (e.g., expert systems and logic programming). A modern history of AI will emphasize breakthroughs outside of the focus of traditional AI text books, in particular, mathematical foundations of today's NNs such as the chain rule (1676), the first NNs (linear regression, circa 1800), and the first working deep learners (1965-). From the perspective of 2022, I provide a timeline of the -- in hindsight -- most important relevant events in the history of NNs, deep learning, AI, computer science, and mathematics in general, crediting those who laid foundations of the field. The text contains numerous hyperlinks to relevant overview sites from my AI Blog. It supplements my previous deep learning survey (2015) which provides hundreds of additional references. Finally, to round it off, I'll put things in a broader historic context spanning the time since the Big Bang until when the universe will be many times older than it is now.},

	abstract = {Statistical modeling of ecological data is often faced with a large number of variables as well as possible nonlinear relationships and higher-order interaction effects. Gradient boosted trees (GBT) have been successful in addressing these issues and have shown a good predictive performance in modeling nonlinear relationships, in particular in classification settings with a categorical response variable.  They also tend to be robust against outliers. However, their black-box nature makes it difficult to interpret these models. We introduce several recently developed statistical tools to the environmental research community in order to advance interpretation of these black-box models. To analyze the properties of the tools, we applied gradient boosted trees to investigate biological health of streams within the contiguous USA, as measured by a benthic macroinvertebrate biotic index. Based on these data and a simulation study, we demonstrate the advantages and limitations of partial dependence plots (PDP), individual conditional expectation (ICE) curves and accumulated local effects (ALE) in their ability to identify covariate–response relationships. Additionally, interaction effects were quantified according to interaction strength (IAS) and Friedman’s \$\$H{\textasciicircum}2\$\$statistic. Interpretable machine learning techniques are useful tools to open the black-box of gradient boosted trees in the environmental sciences. This finding is supported by our case study on the effect of impervious surface on the benthic condition, which agrees with previous results in the literature. Overall, the most important variables were ecoregion, bed stability, watershed area, riparian vegetation and catchment slope. These variables were also present in most identified interaction effects. In conclusion, graphical tools (PDP, ICE, ALE) enable visualization and easier interpretation of GBT but should be supported by analytical statistical measures. Future methodological research is needed to investigate the properties of interaction tests.      Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

It is self-contained, providing the necessary background in linear models, linear mixed models, and generalized linear models (GLMs), before presenting a balanced treatment of the theory and applications of GAMs and related models. 

The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and while firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practical application of the methodology. Each chapter contains an extensive set of exercises, with solutions in an appendix or in the book’s R data package gamair, to enable use as a course text or for self-study.},

A recent proposal for a more X-robust form of quantile regression based on maximal depth ideas is described along with an interesting historical antecedent. Finally, the notorious computational burden of median regression, and quantile regression more generally, is addressed. It is argued that recent developments in interior point methods for linear programming together with some new preprocessing ideas make it possible to compute quantile regressions as quickly as least-squares regressions throughout the entire range of problem sizes encountered in econometrics.},

Corrections:
9:03. The values for the intercept and slope should be the most recent estimates, 0.86 and 0.68, instead of the original random values, 0 and 1.
9:33 the slope should be 0.7.

	abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This "double descent" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses, and has implications for both the theory and practice of machine learning.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2106.05515},
	abstract = {Estimating the data uncertainty in regression tasks is often done by learning a quantile function or a prediction interval of the true label conditioned on the input. It is frequently observed that quantile regression -- a vanilla algorithm for learning quantiles with asymptotic guarantees -- tends to {\textbackslash}emph\{under-cover\} than the desired coverage level in reality. While various fixes have been proposed, a more fundamental understanding of why this under-coverage bias happens in the first place remains elusive. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical study on the coverage of uncertainty estimation algorithms in learning quantiles. We prove that quantile regression suffers from an inherent under-coverage bias, in a vanilla setting where we learn a realizable linear quantile function and there is more data than parameters. More quantitatively, for \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textgreater}0.5\$ and small \$d/n\$, the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-quantile learned by quantile regression roughly achieves coverage \${\textbackslash}alpha - ({\textbackslash}alpha-1/2){\textbackslash}cdot d/n\$ regardless of the noise distribution, where \$d\$ is the input dimension and \$n\$ is the number of training data. Our theory reveals that this under-coverage bias stems from a certain high-dimensional parameter estimation error that is not implied by existing theories on quantile regression. Experiments on simulated and real data verify our theory and further illustrate the effect of various factors such as sample size and model capacity on the under-coverage bias in more practical setups.},

	abstract = {In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\} of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) ∇f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}nabla f\} whose value at a point p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\} gives the direction and the rate of fastest increase. The gradient transforms like a vector under change of basis of the space of variables of f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\}. If the gradient of a function is non-zero at a point p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction, the greatest absolute directional derivative. Further, a point where the gradient is the zero vector is known as a stationary point. The gradient thus plays a fundamental role in optimization theory, where it is used to minimize a function by gradient descent. In coordinate-free terms, the gradient of a function f(r)\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f({\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} )\} may be defined by:

where df\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle df\} is the total infinitesimal change in f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\} for an infinitesimal displacement  dr\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle d{\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} \}, and is seen to be maximal when dr\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle d{\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} \} is in the direction of the gradient ∇f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}nabla f\}. The nabla symbol ∇\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}nabla \}, written as an upside-down triangle and pronounced "del", denotes the vector differential operator.
When a coordinate system is used in which the basis vectors are not functions of position, the gradient is given by the vector whose components are the partial derivatives of f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\} at p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}. That is, for f:Rn→R\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f{\textbackslash}colon {\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\} {\textasciicircum}\{n\}{\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\} \}, its gradient ∇f:Rn→Rn\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}nabla f{\textbackslash}colon {\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\} {\textasciicircum}\{n\}{\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\} {\textasciicircum}\{n\}\} is defined at the point p=(x1,…,xn)\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p=(x\_\{1\},{\textbackslash}ldots ,x\_\{n\})\} in n-dimensional space as the vector
Note that the above definition for gradient is only defined for the function f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\}, if it is differentiable at p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\}. There can be functions for which partial derivatives exist in every direction but fail to be differentiable. 
For example, the function f(x,y)=x2yx2+y2\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f(x,y)=\{{\textbackslash}frac \{x{\textasciicircum}\{2\}y\}\{x{\textasciicircum}\{2\}+y{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}\}\} unless at origin where f(0,0)=0\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f(0,0)=0\}, is not differentiable at the origin as it does not have a well defined tangent plane despite having well defined partial derivatives in every direction at the origin. In this particular example, under rotation of x-y coordinate system, the above formula for gradient fails to transform like a vector (gradient becomes dependent on choice of basis for coordinate system) and also fails to point towards the 'steepest ascent' in some orientations. For differentiable functions where the formula for gradient holds, it can be shown to always transform as a vector under transformation of the basis so as to always point towards the fastest increase.
The gradient is dual to the total derivative df\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle df\}: the value of the gradient at a point is a tangent vector – a vector at each point; while the value of the derivative at a point is a cotangent vector – a linear functional on vectors. They are related in that the dot product of the gradient of f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\} at a point p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\} with another tangent vector v\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}mathbf \{v\} \} equals the directional derivative of f\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\} at p\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\} of the function along v\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}mathbf \{v\} \}; that is, ∇f(p)⋅v=∂f∂v(p)=dfp(v)\{{\textbackslash}textstyle {\textbackslash}nabla f(p){\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}mathbf \{v\} =\{{\textbackslash}frac \{{\textbackslash}partial f\}\{{\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}mathbf \{v\} \}\}(p)=df\_\{p\}({\textbackslash}mathbf \{v\} )\}. 
The gradient admits multiple generalizations to more general functions on manifolds; see § Generalizations.},

In this video, we show how it can be used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals. In Part 2, we'll see how to calculate p-values.

	abstract = {In probability and statistics, an exponential family is a parametric set of probability distributions of a certain form, specified below. This special form is chosen for mathematical convenience, including the enabling of the user to calculate expectations, covariances using differentiation based on some useful algebraic properties, as well as for generality, as exponential families are in a sense very natural sets of distributions to consider. The term exponential class is sometimes used in place of "exponential family", or the older term Koopman–Darmois family.
Sometimes loosely referred to as "the" exponential family, this class of distributions is distinct because they all possess a variety of desirable properties, most importantly the existence of a sufficient statistic.
The concept of exponential families is credited to E. J. G. Pitman, G. Darmois, and B. O. Koopman in 1935–1936. Exponential families of distributions provide a general framework for selecting a possible alternative parameterisation of a parametric family of distributions, in terms of natural parameters, and for defining useful sample statistics, called the natural sufficient statistics of the family.},

This new edition of a bestseller has been updated with new sections on non-linear associations, strategies for model selection, and a Postface on good statistical practice.

Like its predecessor, this edition presents the theoretical background of generalized linear models (GLMs) before focusing on methods for analyzing particular kinds of data. It covers Normal, Poisson, and Binomial distributions; linear regression models; classical estimation and model fitting methods; and frequentist methods of statistical inference. After forming this foundation, the authors explore multiple linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), logistic regression, log-linear models, survival analysis, multilevel modeling, Bayesian models, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.


Introduces GLMs in a way that enables readers to understand the unifying structure that underpins them


Discusses common concepts and principles of advanced GLMs, including nominal and ordinal regression, survival analysis, non-linear associations and longitudinal analysis


Connects Bayesian analysis and MCMC methods to fit GLMs


Contains numerous examples from business, medicine, engineering, and the social sciences


Provides the example code for R, Stata, and WinBUGS to encourage implementation of the methods


Offers the data sets and solutions to the exercises online


Describes the components of good statistical practice to improve scientific validity and reproducibility of results.

Using popular statistical software programs, this concise and accessible text illustrates practical approaches to estimation, model fitting, and model comparisons.},

The book presents a broad, in-depth overview of the most commonly usedstatistical models by discussing the theory underlying the models, R software applications,and examples with crafted models to elucidate key ideas and promote practical modelbuilding. The book begins by illustrating the fundamentals of linear models, such as how the model-fitting projects the data onto a model vector subspace and how orthogonal decompositions of the data yield information about the effects of explanatory variables. Subsequently, the book covers the most popular generalized linear models, which include binomial and multinomial logistic regression for categorical data, and Poisson and negative binomial loglinear models for count data. Focusing on the theoretical underpinnings of these models, Foundations ofLinear and Generalized Linear Models also features:  An introduction to quasi-likelihood methods that require weaker distributional assumptions, such as generalized estimating equation methods An overview of linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models with random effects for clustered correlated data, Bayesian modeling, and extensions to handle problematic cases such as high dimensional problems Numerous examples that use R software for all text data analyses More than 400 exercises for readers to practice and extend the theory, methods, and data analysis A supplementary website with datasets for the examples and exercises  An invaluable textbook for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level students in statistics and biostatistics courses, Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models is also an excellent reference for practicing statisticians and biostatisticians, as well as anyone who is interested in learning about the most important statistical models for analyzing data.},

GLM theory is predicated on the exponential family of distributions--a class so rich that it includes the commonly used logit, probit, and Poisson models. Although one can fit these models in Stata by using specialized commands (for example, logit for logit models), fitting them as GLMs with Stata's glm command offers some advantages. For example, model diagnostics may be calculated and interpreted similarly regardless of the assumed distribution. This text thoroughly covers GLMs, both theoretically and computationally, with an emphasis on Stata. The theory consists of showing how the various GLMs are special cases of the exponential family, showing general properties of this family of distributions, and showing the derivation of maximum likelihood (ML) estimators and standard errors. Hardin and Hilbe show how iteratively reweighted least squares, another method of parameter estimation, are a consequence of ML estimation using Fisher scoring.},

	abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a non-negligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165v3},
	abstract = {It has long been known that a single-layer fully-connected neural network with an i.i.d. prior over its parameters is equivalent to a Gaussian process (GP), in the limit of infinite network width. This correspondence enables exact Bayesian inference for infinite width neural networks on regression tasks by means of evaluating the corresponding GP. Recently, kernel functions which mimic multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a Bayesian framework. As such, previous work has not identified that these kernels can be used as covariance functions for GPs and allow fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. In this work, we derive the exact equivalence between infinitely wide deep networks and GPs. We further develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance function for these GPs. We then use the resulting GPs to perform Bayesian inference for wide deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We observe that trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding GP with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is strongly correlated with trained network prediction error. We further find that test performance increases as finite-width trained networks are made wider and more similar to a GP, and thus that GP predictions typically outperform those of finite-width networks. Finally we connect the performance of these GPs to the recent theory of signal propagation in random neural networks.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},
