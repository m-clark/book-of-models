# book-of-models

This is the repository for a book ~~tentatively~~ titled:

- Models Demystified
- ~~- Models by Example~~
- ~~- Models from Scratch~~
- ~~- The Book of Models~~
- ~~- The amazing, strange and wondrous tales of a little boy named linear regression~~
- ~~- Something really cool but won't be published as such~~


We've seen many people struggle with understanding how models work, just as we've struggled ourselves during our own journey into data science, and as we still do whenever something new comes along. We've also seen how much easier it is to understand models when they are presented in a way that builds on what's been learned, and when some of the mystery can be taken away with a few key ideas and clear examples. What's more, by showing common threads among the wide universe of models, it's easier to understand how they work, and how they can be used in different situations. We hope this book will provide those who read it a strong, practical foundation and help empower them to explore more on their own.



This should be out on CRC press in 2024 or early 2025. We welcome any feedback in the meantime as it develops, so please feel free to create an issue. For contributions, please see the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page for more information if available, other.
